# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
  Robin wanted to create a web app to showcase information about Mars, in hopes of one day get a job at NASA.  The app was designed to scrape through HTML
  and grab images and data on Mars that could be displayed on a website.  Robin wanted the website to be able to be updated daily with up to date articles.
